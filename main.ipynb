    "### Introduction\n",
    "This project is designed to help you efficiently manage your Gmail inbox by leveraging the power of machine learning and automation. With this application, you can automatically categorize your emails into predefined categories and perform various actions such as marking them as read, moving them to specific folders, or even deleting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**  \n",
    "- **Fetch and Process Emails**: Seamlessly connect to your Gmail account and retrieve the latest emails, including important details like the sender, subject, and body.\n",
    "- **Email Categorization with LLM**: Utilize a language model (LLM) to automatically categorize your emails based on the content, making your inbox more organized.\n",
    "- **Automated Actions**: Depending on the category assigned to each email, the application can automatically perform actions like marking emails as read, moving them to folders, or deleting them.\n",
    "- **Customizable Workflow**: You have full control over how emails are categorized and what actions are taken. Simply configure the settings in the provided files to match your specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You'll Learn:**  \n",
    "In this notebook, you'll learn how to set up and run the application from start to finish. You'll begin by installing the necessary dependencies and setting up environment variables. Then, you'll move on to configuring email categories and actions, fetching and categorizing emails, and finally, performing automated actions on those emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have a fully functional email management tool that you can customize and extend according to your preferences. Whether you're looking to clean up your inbox or streamline your email workflow, this application will help you achieve your goals.\n"

    "\n",
    "Before getting started with this project, you'll need to ensure that the following components are set up on your system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gmail Account with 2-Factor Authentication (2FA):**\n",
    "   - Make sure 2FA is enabled on your Gmail account to add an extra layer of security.\n",
    "   - After enabling 2FA, you'll need to generate an app password. This password allows the tool to securely access your Gmail account. You can generate an app password in your Google account settings under \"Security\", If you can't find it, search for \"App Password.\" Once created, use this as your email password.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ollama Installed Locally or an OpenAI API Key:**\n",
    "   - If you prefer using Ollama's LLMs, ensure that Ollama is installed on your local system. Follow the installation instructions provided by Ollama.\n",
    "   - Alternatively, if you're using OpenAI's models, you'll need an API key from OpenAI. Sign up for an OpenAI account and obtain your API key from the API section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these components are in place, you'll be ready to proceed with setting up and running the application."

    "With this application, you've equipped yourself with a powerful tool to manage your Gmail inbox more effectively, using the latest advancements in language models for intelligent email categorization. This setup not only simplifies your inbox management but also allows for extensive customization through adjustable constants in the `constants.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**  \n",
    "- **Application Logs**: Throughout its execution, the application provides detailed logs of each significant action, such as categorizing emails, applying actions (like sorting or deleting), and handling any errors. These logs are invaluable for troubleshooting and ensuring the application functions as expected.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Metrics Summary**: After processing, the application outputs a summary of its performance, displaying key metrics including:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  metrics = {\n",
    "      'total': 100,          # Total number of emails processed\n",
    "      'success': 100,        # Number of emails successfully categorized and processed\n",
    "      'failed': 0,           # Number of emails that could not be processed\n",
    "      'llm-failures': 0,     # Number of failures related to the language model\n",
    "      'action-failures': 0   # Number of failures related to actions like sorting or deleting emails\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Category Count**: Additionally, the application provides a breakdown of how your emails were distributed across different categories:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  category_count = {\n",
    "      'Promotions': 58, \n",
    "      'Work': 16, \n",
    "      'Verifications': 13, \n",
    "      'Spam': 8, \n",
    "      'Finance Promotions': 1, \n",
    "      'Finances': 1, \n",
    "      'Personal': 1, \n",
    "      'Reminders': 1, \n",
    "      'Support': 1\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  This count offers a clear view of how your emails were categorized, helping you understand the organization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "By regularly reviewing these logs and metrics, you can ensure that your Gmail inbox is being managed as intended, with all emails correctly categorized and processed according to your preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps**  \n",
    "You've taken a significant step toward better inbox management by integrating LLMs for intelligent email categorization. To further enhance performance, consider fine-tuning the constants in the `constants.py` file, such as category definitions and actions, to better align with your email habits. However, it's important to be aware of the potential for false categorization. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your settings will help minimize this risk and ensure that your emails are sorted accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this tool, your Gmail inbox is now more organized, efficient, and tailored to your needs."
